# Compendium of Pocket-Sized Space Objects

The criteria to include something in this list are:
- It can fit in your pocket (typically <1 kg or one dimension <10cm)
- It has been to space for some time (i.e. orbital flight — or planning to go there very soon)
- It is built to do something on its own (no debris/spacecraft parts)
